  <h1>About PeaceMindAI</h1>

  <p>
    PeaceMindAI is an AI-powered mental health support platform designed to offer accessible, personalized, and stigma-free emotional care. 
    Built around an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot, our system helps individuals manage stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD through meaningful conversations, cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, mindfulness practices, and supportive counseling.
  </p>

  <p>
    With 24/7 availability and real-time interaction, PeaceMindAI ensures that help is always within reach, especially for people with limited access to traditional therapy. 
    Our chatbot serves as a first line of support, providing guidance, suggesting self-help resources, and encouraging mental well-being while protecting user privacy and confidentiality.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to conversational support, PeaceMindAI offers curated mental health resources uploaded by professionals, including self-help articles, mindfulness exercises, and therapy guides to complement the AI-driven care.
  </p>

  <p>
    PeaceMindAI is not a replacement for human therapists but a companion that bridges the gap, empowers users, and promotes emotional resilience in todayâ€™s fast-paced world.
